Comparative Demand Forecasting Model for Small Industrial Enterprises
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on time-series forecasting using SARIMA and DeepAR to predict store sales. The goal is to optimize inventory management, reduce stock errors, and enhance demand forecasting accuracy. The models are evaluated using standard performance metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
🚀 Features
•	Implemented SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) and DeepAR for sales forecasting.
•	Optimized model hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
•	Compared model performance using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
•	Visualized predicted vs. actual sales trends for better interpretability.
•	Addressed negative sales values and overfitting issues using data pre-processing techniques.
🔧 Tech Stack
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, GluonTS, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
•	Forecasting Models: SARIMA (Statistical), DeepAR (Deep Learning)
•	Evaluation Metrics: MAPE, MAE
📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical sales data from multiple store locations. It includes:
•	Store ID
•	Date
•	Units Sold
•	Additional Features (if any)
📈 Model Implementation
1️⃣ SARIMA Model
•	Identifies seasonality and trend in sales data.
•	Uses Auto ARIMA to find optimal parameters.
•	Forecasts future sales based on past trends.
2️⃣ DeepAR Model
•	A deep learning approach using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
•	Learns patterns from multiple time series simultaneously.
•	Provides probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals.
📉 Performance Evaluation
The models are compared using:
•	MAPE: Measures percentage error in predictions.
•	MAE: Measures absolute deviation from actual values.
•	Overall Accuracy: DeepAR shows better performance with lower error rates compared to SARIMA.
